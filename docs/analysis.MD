## **File 1: `checkpointer.py` Analysis**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `core/checkpointer.py` module [1] implements a robust, environment-aware factory for creating and managing `LangGraph` checkpointers. It is designed to be resilient and production-ready by automatically selecting the optimal persistence layer (PostgreSQL, SQLite, or in-memory) based on environment variables and available dependencies. The module leverages modern Python 3.13 features like `match-case` and `asyncio.TaskGroup` for clean, concurrent operations. Configuration is managed via a `dataclass`, and health checks are built-in to monitor connection status [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

A comprehensive test suite should validate the module's configuration, environment detection, fallback logic, and error handling.

**Key Components to Test:**
*   **`CheckpointerFactory` Class**: The central component responsible for all creation and management logic [1].
*   **`CheckpointerConfig` Dataclass**: Should be tested for validation logic (e.g., ensuring `connection_timeout` is positive) [1].
*   **`Environment` Enum**: Logic depending on this enum needs to be thoroughly tested [1].

**Main Entry Points for Testing:**
*   `create_optimal_checkpointer(config)`: The primary factory method that orchestrates the entire creation process [1].
*   Convenience functions: `create_development_checkpointer()`, `create_prcheckpointer.mdoduction_checkpointer()`, and `create_memory_checkpointer()` [1].
*   Monitoring functions: `health_check_checkpointers()` and `get_global_factory().cleanup_connections()` [1].

**Required Test Cases:**

1.  **Environment Detection**:
    *   Verify that `_detect_environment()` correctly identifies `PRODUCTION`, `STAGING`, `DEVELOPMENT`, and `TESTING` based on the `ENVIRONMENT` variable [1].
    *   Test the auto-detection logic: it should infer `PRODUCTION` if `POSTGRES_URL` is set and `TESTING` if CI variables (`CI`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, etc.) are present [1].

2.  **Production Checkpointer (`create_production_checkpointer`)**:
    *   Test successful creation of `AsyncPostgresSaver` when `prefer_async` is true and a connection is available [1].
    *   Test fallback to synchronous `PostgresSaver` if the async check fails or `prefer_async` is false [1].
    *   Test final fallback to `AsyncSqliteSaver` (with a logged warning) if PostgreSQL is completely unavailable [1].

3.  **Development Checkpointer (`create_development_checkpointer`)**:
    *   Verify it correctly creates an `AsyncSqliteSaver` by default in the `workspace` directory [1].
    *   Test that it respects the `prefer_async=False` flag and creates a sync `SqliteSaver` [1].

4.  **Testing Checkpointer (`create_testing_checkpointer`)**:
    *   Confirm that it always returns an in-memory `MemorySaver` for fast, isolated tests [1].

5.  **Connection Failure and Fallback**:
    *   Mock connection errors for PostgreSQL to ensure the logic correctly falls back to SQLite [1].
    *   Mock errors for both PostgreSQL and SQLite to ensure the final fallback to `MemorySaver` occurs with the appropriate warnings [1].

6.  **Dependency Handling**:
    *   Test that an `ImportError` is raised with a helpful "pip install" message if required packages (`psycopg`, `aiosqlite`) are missing [1].

7.  **Health Check and Cleanup**:
    *   Test `health_check_all()` to ensure it correctly reports the status of cached connections [1].
    *   Test `cleanup_connections()` to verify that it gracefully closes all connections without errors [1].

**Linked Modules**:
*   `config.settings`: Crucial for determining the `workspace_dir` where the SQLite database is stored [1].
*   `langgraph.checkpoint.*`: The module is a factory for objects from this `LangGraph` namespace (`AsyncPostgresSaver`, `SqliteSaver`, `MemorySaver`, etc.) [1].

---

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

The file is well-engineered, but key improvements can enhance its performance and maintainability, particularly in its async implementation.

**Strengths:**
*   **Resilient Fallback System**: The tiered fallback logic (Async PG -> Sync PG -> Async SQLite -> Memory) is a major strength, ensuring the application can run even with degraded infrastructure [1].
*   **Modern and Readable Code**: The use of `dataclasses`, `Enum`, `match-case`, and `TaskGroup` makes the code clean, type-safe, and aligned with Python 3.13 best practices [1].
*   **Production-Oriented**: Features like connection pooling, health checks, configurable timeouts, and explicit logging demonstrate a mature approach suitable for production deployment [1].
*   **Strong Separation of Concerns**: The factory pattern effectively decouples checkpointer creation logic from the application's core business logic [1].

**Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Blocking I/O in Async Functions**: The `_create_postgres_checkpointer_sync` and `_test_postgres_connection_sync` methods are defined as `async def` but contain synchronous, blocking I/O calls (`psycopg2.connect`). This is a critical performance anti-pattern that can freeze the entire asyncio event loop [1].
2.  **Overuse of `any` Type Hint**: The return type for most creator methods is `any`. This undermines static analysis and type safety, making the code harder to integrate and refactor [1].
3.  **Global Factory Singleton**: The `_global_factory` instance introduces global state, which can complicate testing and lead to non-obvious dependencies. A dependency injection pattern is generally preferred for better test isolation and clarity [1].

### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Isolate Blocking I/O with `asyncio.to_thread`**:
    All synchronous database calls within `async` functions must be wrapped in `await asyncio.to_thread()` to run them in a separate thread, preventing them from blocking the event loop.

    **Example Fix for `_create_postgres_checkpointer_sync`:**
    ```
    # core/checkpointer.py

    import asyncio
    from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
    import psycopg2

    # ... inside CheckpointerFactory

    async def _create_postgres_checkpointer_sync(self) -> any:
        """Create synchronous PostgreSQL checkpointer with non-blocking I/O."""
        try:
            from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
            import psycopg2
            
            conn_str = os.getenv("POSTGRES_URL")
            if not conn_str:
                raise ValueError("POSTGRES_URL not set for sync PostgreSQL checkpointer")

            # Run the blocking psycopg2.connect call in a separate thread
            conn = await asyncio.to_thread(
                psycopg2.connect,
                dsn=conn_str,
                connect_timeout=int(self.config.connection_timeout)
            )
            conn.autocommit = True
            
            checkpointer = PostgresSaver(conn=conn)
            self._connection_cache["postgres_sync"] = conn
            logger.info("✅ Sync PostgreSQL checkpointer created successfully")
            return checkpointer
            
        except ImportError as e:
            logger.error(f"❌ psycopg2-binary not installed: {e}")
            logger.info("💡 Install with: pip install psycopg2-binary")
            raise
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"❌ Sync PostgreSQL checkpointer creation failed: {e}")
            raise
    ```

2.  **Improve Type Safety with `TypeAlias`**:
    Replace the generic `any` return type with a specific `TypeAlias` to improve code clarity, enable static analysis, and enhance developer experience.

    **Implementation:**
    ```
    # core/checkpointer.py

    from typing import Union, TypeAlias, Optional
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
    from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio import AsyncSqliteSaver
    from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver
    from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio import AsyncPostgresSaver
    from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver

    # Define a specific type for all possible checkpointer objects
    Checkpointer = TypeAlias[
        Union[
            AsyncPostgresSaver,
            PostgresSaver,
            AsyncSqliteSaver,
            SqliteSaver,
            MemorySaver,
        ]
    ]

    # ... then in CheckpointerFactory methods
    @classmethod
    async def create_optimal_checkpointer(
        cls, 
        config: Optional[CheckpointerConfig] = None
    ) -> Checkpointer:
        # ... implementation
    ```

3.  **Favor Dependency Injection Over Globals**:
    Refactor the application to instantiate `CheckpointerFactory` at the application's entry point and pass the instance to components that require it. This makes dependencies explicit and simplifies testing by allowing mock factories to be injected. Remove `get_global_factory()` and `_global_factory`.

## **File 2: `llm_config.yaml` Analysis**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `llm_config.yaml` file serves as the central configuration hub for all LLM providers, models, and agent nodes in the Mortey assistant system [1]. It implements a hierarchical YAML structure that defines global settings, provider-specific configurations, individual model parameters, and specialized node configurations for different agent types.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Provider Management**: Defines multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI) with their API key references and model catalogs [1].
*   **Model Configuration**: Specifies detailed parameters for each model including tokens, temperature, and cost tracking [1].
*   **Node Specialization**: Maps agent nodes to specific provider/model combinations with role-specific settings [1].
*   **Global Policy Control**: Establishes system-wide defaults for timeouts, retries, caching, and fallback behavior [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **Global Settings Section**: Top-level configuration defining default providers, retry logic, and system-wide behavior flags [1].
*   **Provider Configurations**: Structured definitions for each LLM provider including API key environment variables and model catalogs [1].
*   **Model Definitions**: Detailed specifications for individual models with performance and cost parameters [1].
*   **Node Configurations**: Agent-specific settings mapping roles to optimal provider/model combinations [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

*   **`config/settings.py`**: Loads and validates this YAML configuration using PyYAML [1].
*   **Environment Variables**: References `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for secure API access [1].
*   **`agents/agents.py`**: Consumes node configurations for agent initialization [1].
*   **`config/llm_manager.py`**: Uses provider and model configurations for LLM instantiation [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`global` section**: Defines system-wide defaults including `default_provider`, `fallback_provider`, `retry_attempts`, and feature flags [1].
*   **`providers` section**: Configures LLM providers with `api_key_env` references and nested model definitions [1].
*   **`models` subsections**: Specify `model_id`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `cost_per_1m_tokens` for each model [1].
*   **`nodes` section**: Maps agent roles to specific provider/model combinations with specialized parameters [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should focus on YAML structure validation, configuration completeness, cross-reference integrity, and parameter range validation to ensure the configuration is both syntactically correct and operationally sound.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   **YAML Structure Integrity**: Validation that the file parses correctly and matches expected schema [1] [3].
*   **Provider-Model Consistency**: Verification that all node references point to existing providers and models [1].
*   **Parameter Range Validation**: Ensuring temperature values (0.0-1.0), token limits, and cost values are reasonable [1].
*   **Environment Variable References**: Confirming API key environment variables are correctly specified [1].
*   **Fallback Chain Validity**: Testing that fallback providers and models exist and are properly configured [1].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   YAML parsing and schema validation
*   Provider configuration completeness
*   Model parameter validation
*   Node-to-provider reference integrity
*   Environment variable resolution

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **YAML Structure Validation**:
    - Parse `llm_config.yaml` using PyYAML and verify no syntax errors [1] [3].
    - Validate that all required top-level sections (`global`, `providers`, `nodes`) are present [1].

2.  **Provider Configuration Completeness**:
    - Verify each provider has `api_key_env` field pointing to valid environment variable names [1].
    - Confirm all providers have at least one model defined in their `models` section [1].

3.  **Model Parameter Validation**:
    - Test that all `temperature` values are between 0.0 and 1.0 [1].
    - Verify `max_tokens` values are positive integers within reasonable ranges (100-8192) [1].
    - Confirm `cost_per_1m_tokens` values are positive numbers [1].

4.  **Node Reference Integrity**:
    - Verify each node's `provider` field references an existing provider in the `providers` section [1].
    - Confirm each node's `model` field references an existing model within the specified provider [1].
    - Test that `supervisor` node has minimal `max_tokens` (5) for fast routing decisions [1].

5.  **Fallback Configuration**:
    - Verify `fallback_provider` in global settings references an existing provider [1].
    - Test that fallback provider has models available for all node types [1].

6.  **Environment Variable Security**:
    - Confirm no actual API keys are hardcoded in the YAML file [1].
    - Verify all `api_key_env` values follow standard environment variable naming conventions [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**

*   **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear separation between global settings, provider configs, and node specializations promotes maintainability [1].
*   **Security-First Design**: Proper use of environment variable references for API keys prevents credential exposure [1].
*   **Role-Based Optimization**: Node configurations are optimized for specific tasks (fast routing for supervisor, high-quality generation for coder) [1] [4].
*   **Cost Transparency**: Explicit cost tracking per model enables budget monitoring and optimization [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

*   **Static Configuration**: No support for dynamic model selection based on load, cost, or performance metrics [1].
*   **Limited Validation**: YAML structure lacks built-in schema validation or type checking [1] [6].
*   **Hardcoded Relationships**: Node-to-model mappings are static and cannot adapt to provider availability [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Add Schema Validation**:
    ```
    # Add schema validation using JSON Schema or CUE
    $schema: "llm_config_schema.json"
    version: "1.0"
    ```
    This enables automated validation and better IDE support [6].

2.  **Implement Dynamic Model Selection**:
    ```
    nodes:
      coder:
        provider: "anthropic"
        model_preferences: ["claude-4-sonnet", "claude-3-5-haiku"]  # Fallback order
        selection_strategy: "cost_optimized"  # or "performance_optimized"
    ```

3.  **Add Environment-Specific Overrides**:
    ```
    environments:
      development:
        global:
          default_provider: "openai"  # Cheaper for dev
      production:
        global:
          default_provider: "anthropic"  # Higher quality for prod
    ```

4.  **Include Model Capability Metadata**:
    ```
    providers:
      anthropic:
        models:
          claude-4-sonnet:
            capabilities: ["code", "analysis", "reasoning"]
            context_window: 200000
            supports_tools: true
            performance_tier: "premium"
    ```

*   **`compress_state_async()`**: Asynchronous state compression for large conversation histories using `TaskGroup` [2].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should focus on the robustness of the validation system, the accuracy of sanitization logic, and the performance of optimization algorithms under various edge cases and malformed data scenarios.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   **TypedDict Structure Integrity**: Validation that all state instances conform to the `AssistantState` TypedDict specification [2].

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **TypedDict Validation**:
    - Create state with `create_optimized_state()` and verify all required fields are present and correctly typed [2].
    - Test validation with missing required fields (`session_id`, `user_id`, `current_agent`) and verify appropriate errors [2].

2.  **Message Validation Scenarios**:
    - Test validation with mixed message types (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`, `SystemMessage`) [2].
    - Validate `AIMessage` with tool calls but empty content, and verify it passes validation [2].
    - Test strict mode validation with empty `HumanMessage` content and verify it fails [2].

3.  **Async Validation Performance**:
    - Create large state with 1000+ messages and compare sync vs async validation performance [2].
    - Test `TaskGroup` failure scenarios and verify fallback to synchronous validation [2].

4.  **Sanitization and Recovery**:
    - Pass malformed state with non-string `session_id` and verify sanitization converts it properly [2].
    - Test sanitization with empty or None values and verify appropriate defaults are applied [2].

5.  **Legacy Migration**:
    - Test migration from old state format with `thread_id` instead of `session_id` using match-case logic [2].
    - Verify migration handles missing fields gracefully and creates valid state [2].

6.  **State Optimization**:
    - Test `optimize_state_for_processing()` with 100+ messages and verify it preserves system messages while trimming others [2].
    - Test compression levels 1-3 and verify appropriate message reduction strategies [2].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**

*   **Modern Python 3.13.4 Features**: Excellent use of `TaskGroup` for concurrent validation, match-case for clean conditional logic, and enhanced type hints with `collections.abc` imports [2].
*   **Comprehensive Validation Framework**: Multi-layered validation with detailed error reporting, warnings, and metadata provides excellent debugging capabilities [2].
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed data with sanitization fallbacks ensures system stability even with invalid inputs [2].
*   **Performance-Oriented Design**: Async validation, state compression, and intelligent message trimming demonstrate focus on scalability [2].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

*   **Complex Validation Logic**: The multi-strategy validation in `StateValidator` is powerful but complex, making debugging validation failures potentially challenging [2].
*   **Memory Overhead**: Maintaining full message history in state can consume significant memory in long conversations [2].
*   **Hardcoded Optimization Parameters**: Values like `max_messages=20` in optimization functions are hardcoded, limiting runtime configurability [2].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Add Validation Tracing**:
    ```
    @dataclass
    class ValidationResult:
        validation_path: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # Track which validators ran
        
    def validate_state(state, strict=False, trace=False):
        if trace:
            result.validation_path.append("basic_structure_check")
    ```

2.  **Implement Configurable Optimization**:
    ```
    @dataclass
    class StateOptimizationConfig:
        max_messages: int = 20
        preserve_system_messages: bool = True
        compression_level: int = 1
        
    def optimize_state_for_processing(state, config: StateOptimizationConfig = None):
        config = config or StateOptimizationConfig()
    ```

3.  **Add State Metrics and Monitoring**:
    ```
    def get_state_health_metrics(state: AssistantState) -> dict:
        return {
            "memory_usage_mb": sys.getsizeof(state) / 1024 / 1024,
            "message_velocity": calculate_message_rate(state),
            "validation_score": get_validation_confidence(state)
        }
    ```

4.  **Implement State Versioning**:
    ```
    class AssistantState(TypedDict):
        _state_version: str  # Add versioning for future migrations
        messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]
        # ... other fields
    ```

## **File 5: `error_handling.py` Analysis**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `core/error_handling.py` file provides a sophisticated, self-contained module for advanced error management and system resilience [1]. It is designed to be a central service for the entire application, offering layered defenses against common failures in LLM-powered systems.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Intelligent Error Classification**: Dynamically classifies exceptions based on their type, content, and the context in which they occurred [1].
*   **Circuit Breaking**: Protects external services (like LLM APIs or tools) from being overwhelmed by repeated requests during an outage, preventing cascading failures [1].
*   **Automated Retries**: Wraps function calls with an asynchronous, configurable retry mechanism that uses exponential backoff and jitter [1].
*   **Graceful Fallbacks**: Generates context-aware, user-friendly fallback messages to maintain a smooth user experience even when errors occur [1].
*   **Monitoring and Analytics**: Actively tracks error trends and the health of external services, providing statistics for monitoring and debugging [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`ErrorHandler`**: The main public-facing class that orchestrates all error handling logic. It acts as a facade, exposing static methods to wrap function calls, handle exceptions, and retrieve statistics [1].
*   **`ErrorClassifier`**: A powerful classification engine that uses a prioritized list of `ErrorPattern`s, contextual clues, and dynamic pattern learning to determine the precise `ErrorType` of any given exception [1].
*   **`CircuitBreakerManager`**: Manages the state (`closed`, `open`, `half_open`) of circuit breakers for various external services, deciding when to allow calls, and when to block them to let the service recover [1].
*   **`ErrorType`**: A comprehensive `Enum` that defines all possible error categories, providing a standardized taxonomy for errors across the system [1].
*   **`ErrorPattern`, `CircuitBreakerState`, `AssistantError`**: `Dataclasses` that provide structured objects for configuration, state management, and error responses, enhancing code readability and type safety [1].
*   **`CircuitBreakerOpenException`**: A custom exception raised when a call is attempted on a service whose circuit breaker is open [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

This module is designed to be highly self-contained and does not have dependencies on other custom project modules like `config` or `tools`. Its imports are primarily from the Python standard library, making it a portable core utility [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`handle_error(error, context)`**: The central function for processing an exception. It classifies the error, generates a detailed `AssistantError` object, logs it, and returns a structured dictionary for the caller [1].
*   **`with_error_handling(func, context, max_retries)`**: A high-level async wrapper that executes a given function with automated retry logic, applying exponential backoff for retryable errors [1].
*   **`with_circuit_breaker(service_name, func, context)`**: An async wrapper that protects a function call using the circuit breaker for the specified service [1].
*   **`safe_execute_with_fallback(primary_func, fallback_func, context)`**: A resilient execution wrapper that tries a primary function and, upon failure, automatically executes a fallback function [1].
*   **`get_error_statistics()`**: An async method that concurrently gathers and returns a comprehensive report on error trends and circuit breaker statuses [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should focus on the three core pillars of the module: the accuracy of the classifier, the state machine logic of the circuit breaker, and the behavior of the async wrappers under failure conditions.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   The accuracy of the `ErrorClassifier` across a wide range of standard and custom exceptions, especially where string patterns and exception types might overlap [1] [5].
*   The complete lifecycle of the `CircuitBreakerState`: ensuring it correctly transitions from `closed` to `open`, then to `half_open`, and back to `closed` based on call success and failure [1].
*   The retry logic in `with_error_handling`, including verifying the number of retries and the exponential backoff delay calculation [1].
*   The generation of appropriate, context-aware fallback messages for different error scenarios [1].
*   The module's ability to handle both `async` and synchronous functions correctly within its wrappers [1].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   `ErrorHandler.handle_error()`
*   `ErrorHandler.with_error_handling()`
*   `CircuitBreakerManager.call_with_circuit_breaker()`
*   `ErrorClassifier.classify_error()`
*   `ErrorHandler.safe_execute_with_fallback()`

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Error Classification**:
    - Pass a `ConnectionError` containing the string "rate limit". Assert it is classified as `RATE_LIMIT` (due to pattern priority) and not `CONNECTION_ERROR` [1].
    - Pass a generic `Exception` with the context "supervisor". Assert it is correctly classified as `SUPERVISOR_ERROR` based on context [1].
2.  **Circuit Breaker Logic**:
    - Wrap a consistently failing function with `with_circuit_breaker`. After enough calls, assert the breaker's state is `open` and it raises `CircuitBreakerOpenException` [1].
    - Wait for the recovery timeout, call again, and assert the state is `half_open`.
    - Call a succeeding version of the function and assert the state returns to `closed`.
3.  **Retry Wrapper Behavior**:
    - Wrap a failing function in `with_error_handling`. Mock `asyncio.sleep` and count the calls to ensure it retries exactly `max_retries` times before returning an error response [1].
    - Test that a non-retryable error (e.g., `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR`) does not trigger any retries [1].
4.  **Fallback Generation**:
    - Call `generate_fallback_response` with `error_type=ErrorType.TOOL_ERROR` and `context="agent_execution"`. Assert the specific agent-related message is returned [1].
5.  **Statistics Aggregation**:
    - Trigger several different errors and then call `get_error_statistics()`. Assert that the returned dictionary contains the correct structure and non-zero counts for error distribution and circuit breaker status [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**
*   **Layered Resilience**: The combination of classification, retries, circuit breaking, and fallbacks provides a multi-layered defense against failures, which is essential for production systems [1] [6].
*   **Highly Decoupled**: The module is self-contained and exposes its functionality through clear, static methods, making it easy to apply error handling consistently across the entire application [1] [3].
*   **Production-Ready Monitoring**: The built-in analytics for tracking error trends and service health (`get_error_statistics`) are advanced features that provide critical observability into the system's runtime behavior [1].
*   **Modern and Efficient**: The code makes excellent use of modern Python features, including `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent analytics and `match-case` for clean, readable conditional logic [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**
*   **Static State Management**: The use of static class members for the classifier and circuit breaker manager (`ErrorHandler._classifier`, `_circuit_breaker_manager`) acts like a global singleton. This can introduce hidden state and make unit testing more difficult, as state can leak between tests [1].
*   **Hardcoded Configurations**: Error patterns and circuit breaker settings are hardcoded directly in the Python file. In a production environment, operators should be able to tune these parameters (e.g., retry counts, recovery timeouts) without requiring a code deployment [1].
*   **High Complexity**: The multi-strategy logic within `ErrorClassifier` is powerful but also complex. Debugging a misclassification could be challenging without deep insight into which strategy (pattern, context, dynamic) was used [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**
1.  **Adopt Dependency Injection for State**:
    - Refactor `ErrorHandler` to be an instantiable class rather than a collection of static methods. The `ErrorClassifier` and `CircuitBreakerManager` would be instantiated and passed into the `ErrorHandler`'s constructor. This would eliminate global state and allow for easy injection of mock objects during testing.
2.  **Externalize Configurations**:
    - Move the `ErrorPattern` definitions and the `service_configs` from `CircuitBreakerManager` into an external `YAML` or `JSON` file. The classes would load this configuration at startup. This allows for dynamic tuning of the error handling behavior without changing the code.
3.  **Enhance Classification Debuggability**:
    - Add detailed logging within the `classify_error` method to explicitly state which strategy led to the final classification. For example: `logger.debug(f"Classified error as {error_type} via high-priority string pattern.")`. This would provide invaluable insight during debugging.

## **File 6: `agents.py` Analysis**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `agents/agents.py` module implements a sophisticated, asynchronous `AgentFactory` responsible for the entire lifecycle of the system's agents. This factory uses a configuration-driven approach, where each agent's behavior, tools, and underlying LLM are defined in a structured `AgentConfig` dataclass. This architecture promotes modularity, consistency, and ease of maintenance [^1].

The factory's key responsibilities include:

* **Dynamic Initialization**: Agents are initialized concurrently using Python 3.13's `asyncio.TaskGroup` for fast startup [^1].
* **Tool Management**: It dynamically initializes and assigns tools (e.g., file system, web search) to agents based on their configuration. It gracefully handles the absence of dependencies or API keys [^1].
* **Robust Agent Creation**: It creates modern `tool-calling` agents using `langchain.agents.create_tool_calling_agent` and wraps them in an `AgentExecutor`. It includes a fallback mechanism to create a simpler conversational chain if the LLM fails to bind to the tools [^1].
* **Resilience and Monitoring**: The architecture is highly resilient, wrapping agent executions in a circuit breaker and robust error handling. It creates fallback agents if initialization fails and provides methods for health checks and statistics [^1].

This design represents a significant enhancement over a static, function-based approach, providing a scalable and production-ready foundation for a multi-agent system.

### **Main Classes**

* **`AgentFactory`**: The central class that orchestrates the entire agent lifecycle, from tool initialization to agent creation, execution, and monitoring [^1].
* **`AgentConfig`**: A `dataclass` that provides a structured, declarative way to define the properties of each agent, including its type, prompt, LLM, and tools. It includes `__post_init__` validation [^1].
* **`AgentType`**: An `Enum` that defines the categories of agents available in the system (e.g., `CHAT`, `CODER`) [^1].


### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

* **`config.settings`**: Provides global application configuration, likely used for file paths or other settings [^1].
* **`config.llm_manager`**: Manages and provides access to the various LLM instances used by the agents [^1].
* **`tools.file_tools`**: Supplies the file system tools used by agents like `coder` and `file_manager` [^1].
* **`core.state`**: Defines the `AssistantState` object, which is passed between nodes in the LangGraph graph [^1].
* **`core.error_handling`**: Provides the `ErrorHandler` class used to wrap agent executions for robust error management [^1].
* **`core.circuit_breaker`**: Provides the `global_circuit_breaker` to prevent repeated failures in agent or LLM calls [^1].


### **Key Functions and Methods**

* **`initialize_agents()`**: The main public-facing asynchronous method that initializes all tools and then creates all defined agents concurrently using an `asyncio.TaskGroup` [^1].
* **`_initialize_tools()`**: A private method that prepares shared tools, such as file system tools and web search tools, checking for necessary API keys (`TAVILY_API_KEY`) and dependencies [^1].
* **`_create_agent_async()`**: The core private method for building a single agent. It retrieves the LLM, creates a prompt, and attempts to create a tool-calling `AgentExecutor`. It intelligently falls back to a simple conversational chain if tool binding fails [^1].
* **`_wrap_agent_with_protection()`**: A higher-order function that wraps a created agent runnable with error handling and circuit breaker logic, making it resilient for execution within the graph [^1].
* **`_process_tool_agent()` / `_process_chat_agent()`**: The actual agent invocation logic designed to be used as LangGraph nodes. They handle extracting input from the `AssistantState` and formatting the output correctly [^1].
* **`health_check_agents()` / `get_factory_statistics()`**: Public methods for monitoring the status and composition of the agents managed by the factory [^1].


### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should focus on the factory's lifecycle management, the correctness of agent creation under various conditions, and the robustness of its error-handling and fallback mechanisms.

### **Key Testing Focus**

* The concurrent and resilient initialization of agents via `initialize_agents`.
* Graceful handling of missing optional dependencies like the `TavilySearchResults` tool when its API key is not set [^1].
* The critical fallback logic in `_create_agent_async` where a failure to bind tools correctly results in the creation of a simpler, non-tool-using agent [^1].
* The effectiveness of the protection layers, including the circuit breaker and the `ErrorHandler` wrapper.
* The dynamic management capabilities, such as adding and removing agents at runtime.


### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

* `AgentFactory.initialize_agents()`: To test the end-to-end creation process.
* `AgentFactory._create_agent_async()`: To unit test the creation logic for a single agent.
* `AgentFactory._process_tool_agent()`: To test the agent invocation logic as it would run in a graph.
* `AgentConfig.__post_init__`: To verify the validation of agent configurations.


### **Required Test Cases**

1. **`AgentConfig` Validation**:
    * Test that `__post_init__` raises `ValueError` for invalid configurations (e.g., empty name, zero `max_iterations`) [^1].
2. **`AgentFactory` Initialization**:
    * Test that `initialize_agents` succeeds and all default agents are created when all dependencies are present.
    * Test the global failure scenario: if tool initialization fails, ensure the factory creates minimal fallback agents for all defined types [^1].
3. **Web Tool Integration**:
    * Test that `TavilySearchResults` tools are correctly initialized when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is present and gracefully skipped with a warning when it is absent [^1].
4. **Individual Agent Creation**:
    * Test that a tool-enabled agent (like `coder`) correctly creates an `AgentExecutor` [^1].
    * Mock a `bind_tools` failure to verify that the system correctly falls back to creating a simple conversational chain (`prompt | llm`) [^1].
5. **Resilience Mechanisms**:
    * Test the circuit breaker by mocking repeated failures for an agent and verifying that the breaker opens [^1].
    * Test the `ErrorHandler` by mocking an exception during agent invocation and ensuring a user-friendly `AIMessage` is returned [^1].
6. **Dynamic Management**:
    * Test that `add_custom_agent` and `remove_agent` correctly modify the factory's agent pool [^1].

### **Architectural Review \& Recommendations**

The `agents.py` file demonstrates a strong, modern architecture for a multi-agent system. However, several enhancements could further improve its type safety, configuration management, and testability.

**Strengths:**

* **Configuration-Driven Design**: Using `AgentConfig` dataclasses to define agents makes the system highly modular and easy to extend. Adding a new agent is as simple as adding a new configuration entry [^1].
* **Asynchronous and Concurrent**: The use of `async` methods and `asyncio.TaskGroup` for initialization is a modern, performant approach ideal for I/O-bound tasks like setting up LLMs and tools [^1].
* **Exceptional Resilience**: The multi-layered defense—including circuit breakers, explicit error handling for each agent, and fallback agent creation—makes the system robust and suitable for production [^1].
* **Modern LangChain Usage**: The code correctly uses `create_tool_calling_agent` and `AgentExecutor`, which is the standard for building agents in recent LangChain versions [^1].


### **Weaknesses \& Areas for Improvement**

1. **Overuse of `typing.Any`**: Agent instances, tools, and runnables are frequently typed as `Any`. This sacrifices the benefits of static type checking, making the code harder to reason about and refactor safely [^1].
2. **Hardcoded Configurations**: Agent prompts and settings are hardcoded within the `_initialize_agent_configs` method. This makes it difficult for operators to tune prompts or change agent behavior without modifying Python code, which is not ideal for production environments [^1].
3. **Global Factory Instance**: The module relies on a global singleton instance (`agent_factory`). This creates implicit dependencies and can complicate testing, as tests might interfere with each other through this shared state [^1].

### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1. **Improve Type Safety with `TypeAlias`**:
Replace `Any` with more specific types. A `TypeAlias` can be created for the agent runnables to distinguish between an `AgentExecutor` and a simple `Runnable` chain.

**Implementation Example:**

```python
from typing import Union, TypeAlias
from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor

# Define a specific type for agent runnables
AgentRunnable = TypeAlias[Union[AgentExecutor, Runnable]]

# In AgentFactory
class AgentFactory:
    self.agents: dict[str, AgentRunnable] = {}

    async def _create_agent_async(self, ..., agent_config: AgentConfig) -> AgentRunnable:
        # ... returns either AgentExecutor or a Runnable chain
```

2. **Externalize Agent Configurations**:
Move the agent configurations from the Python file to an external format like `YAML` or `JSON`. This allows for easier management and modification of prompts, models, and tool settings without code deployments.

**Example (`agents_config.yaml`):**

```yaml
chat:
  agent_type: "CHAT"
  llm_node: "chat"
  system_prompt: "You are Mortey, a helpful AI assistant..."
  tools_enabled: false
  max_iterations: 5
coder:
  agent_type: "CODER"
  llm_node: "coder"
  system_prompt: "You are Mortey's coding specialist..."
  tools_enabled: true
  tool_names: ["file_tools"]
  max_iterations: 15
```

The `_initialize_agent_configs` method would then be responsible for loading and parsing this file.
3. **Adopt Dependency Injection**:
Refactor the application to avoid the global `agent_factory` instance. The factory should be instantiated at the application's main entry point and passed explicitly to the components that need it (like the supervisor graph). This makes dependencies clear and simplifies testing by allowing for the injection of mock factories.

## **File 7: `assistant_core.py` Analysis**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `core/assistant_core.py` file serves as the main entry point and central nervous system of the entire application [1]. It uses FastAPI to expose API and WebSocket endpoints, and its lifecycle is meticulously managed by an `asynccontextmanager` (`lifespan`) to ensure that all subsystems are initialized at startup and gracefully shut down.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **System Integration**: It initializes and orchestrates all core components, including the `AgentFactory`, `LLMManager`, `Checkpointer`, and `Supervisor` graph, in the correct dependency order [1].
*   **Request Handling**: It manages all incoming requests, whether via WebSocket or a RESTful API, routing them to the message processing pipeline [1].
*   **State and Session Management**: It handles the creation, retrieval, and persistence of conversational states (`AssistantState`), integrating with the `Checkpointer` to load and save session data [1].
*   **Proactive Monitoring and Recovery**: It runs continuous background tasks to monitor system health and clean up expired sessions. It includes logic to automatically trigger a recovery cycle if system health degrades [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`AssistantCore`**: The primary class that glues all application components together, manages the FastAPI app, and handles the main processing loop [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

*   **`core.state`**: Imports `AssistantState` to define the structure of session data [1].
*   **`core.supervisor`**: Imports and instantiates the `Supervisor` to orchestrate agentic workflows [1].
*   **`agents.agents`**: Imports the global `agent_factory` to initialize agents and tools [1].
*   **`core.checkpointer`**: Imports `create_optimal_checkpointer` to set up persistence [1].
*   **`core.error_handling`**: Uses `handle_error` for centralized exception management [1].
*   **`core.circuit_breaker`**: Imports the `global_circuit_breaker` for resilience [1].
*   **`config.llm_manager`**: Imports the `llm_manager` singleton for LLM access [1].
*   **`config.settings`**: Imports the master `config` object [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`lifespan(app)`**: An `@asynccontextmanager` that orchestrates the `initialize` and `graceful_shutdown` methods, tying them to the FastAPI application's startup and shutdown events [1].
*   **`initialize()`**: The core startup method that initializes the checkpointer, agent factory, and supervisor in the correct sequence [1].
*   **`graceful_shutdown()`**: Ensures all resources, such as database connections and monitoring tasks, are cleanly closed [1].
*   **`process_message(message, session_id, ...)`**: The main pipeline for handling a user message. It retrieves the session state, updates it, and invokes the supervisor's LangGraph graph to get a response [1].
*   **`_get_session_state(session_id, ...)`**: A critical method for session management that either retrieves an existing session from memory/checkpointer or creates a new one [1].
*   **`_get_system_status()`**: A comprehensive health check endpoint that uses `asyncio.TaskGroup` to concurrently gather the status of all major subsystems (agents, circuit breakers, checkpointer, LLMs) [1].
*   **`_health_monitoring_task()` / `_trigger_health_recovery()`**: Background tasks that continuously monitor system health and can trigger a recovery sequence (e.g., re-initializing agents) if performance degrades significantly [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should focus on the integration points between the various core modules and the correct handling of the application's lifecycle, from initialization to shutdown, including error and recovery scenarios.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   The complete system initialization chain and the graceful shutdown process [2].
*   End-to-end message processing through both the WebSocket and API endpoints [2].
*   Session state management, including creation, persistence via the checkpointer, and restoration [2].
*   The resilience of the system, particularly the health monitoring and automated recovery logic [2].
*   The accuracy and completeness of the `/api/status` endpoint.

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   The `lifespan` context manager, which triggers `initialize` and `shutdown`.
*   The `/ws` WebSocket endpoint.
*   The `/api/message` POST endpoint.
*   The `/api/status` GET endpoint.

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Initialization and Shutdown**:
    - Start the FastAPI app and verify that all components (agents, supervisor, etc.) are initialized without errors.
    - Send a shutdown signal and assert that `graceful_shutdown` is called and completes successfully [2].
2.  **Message Processing**:
    - Send a message via the WebSocket. Assert that a valid response is received and that the session state is updated in the `active_sessions` dictionary [1].
    - Send a message via the API endpoint and verify the same correct behavior.
3.  **Session Persistence**:
    - Process a message to create a session.
    - Simulate a restart of the `AssistantCore`.
    - Process a new message with the same `session_id`. Assert that the conversation history from the previous session is correctly loaded from the checkpointer and is present in the new state [2].
4.  **Health and Recovery**:
    - Mock a component's health check to return a failure status.
    - Call the `/api/status` endpoint and assert that the unhealthy status is reflected.
    - Mock the health score to be below the recovery threshold. Assert that `_trigger_health_recovery` is called by the monitoring task [1].
5.  **Error Handling**:
    - Mock the `supervisor.supervisor_graph.ainvoke` method to raise an exception.
    - Process a message and assert that a structured error response from `handle_error` is returned to the client without crashing the application [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**

*   **Robust Lifecycle Management**: The use of FastAPI's `lifespan` context manager provides a clean, explicit, and reliable way to manage the startup and shutdown of complex, interconnected services [1].
*   **Proactive Resilience**: The inclusion of background tasks for health monitoring and automated recovery (`_health_monitoring_task`, `_trigger_health_recovery`) is an advanced, production-grade feature that makes the system highly resilient [1].
*   **Centralized Integration**: The `AssistantCore` serves as an excellent "main" orchestrator, providing a clear single point of entry and integration for all other modules. This simplifies the application's top-level logic.
*   **Comprehensive Observability**: The `/api/status` endpoint, which concurrently gathers health data from all subsystems, provides outstanding observability into the application's real-time state [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

*   **Reliance on Global Singletons**: The class directly imports and uses global singleton instances for `agent_factory`, `llm_manager`, and `global_circuit_breaker`. This creates tight coupling and hidden state, which complicates testing and makes the components less reusable [1].
*   **In-Memory Session Management**: While sessions are persisted via a checkpointer, the primary `active_sessions` dictionary is stored in memory. In a distributed or multi-instance deployment, this would not work, as sessions would be siloed to the instance that created them.
*   **Direct Graph Invocation**: The `process_message` method directly invokes `self.supervisor.supervisor_graph.ainvoke`. This bypasses the potentially more abstract `supervisor.process()` method, creating a tighter coupling between the core and the supervisor's internal implementation details [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Adopt Dependency Injection**:
    - Refactor `AssistantCore` to accept its dependencies (`Supervisor`, `AgentFactory`, etc.) in its `__init__` method. These components would be instantiated at the application's root (e.g., in a `main.py` file) and passed in. This would eliminate global singletons and dramatically improve testability and modularity.
2.  **Decouple Session Caching from Core Logic**:
    - For scalability, the session management should not rely on a simple in-memory dictionary. Replace `self.active_sessions` with a more robust, distributed caching layer (like Redis) that sits in front of the persistent checkpointer. This would allow multiple application instances to share session state seamlessly.
3.  **Use a More Abstract Interface for Supervisor**:
    - The call to the supervisor should be `await self.supervisor.process(updated_state, config)`. This would use the public interface of the `Supervisor` class, allowing its internal implementation (e.g., the name of its graph attribute) to change without breaking the `AssistantCore`. This enforces better abstraction boundaries between components.


## **File 8: `supervisor.py`**

    ### **Architectural Overview**

The `core/supervisor.py` file defines the central orchestrator for the multi-agent system, acting as the "brain" or fleet manager for the various agents [1] [4]. It leverages LangGraph v0.4.8 to construct a stateful graph that intelligently routes user requests to the most appropriate agent.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Intelligent Routing**: It analyzes user input against a configurable set of keywords to direct tasks to specialized agents (e.g., "coder", "web") or a default conversational agent [1].
*   **Graph Orchestration**: It builds, compiles, and executes a `StateGraph`, managing the flow of the `AssistantState` between agents and tools [1] [5].
*   **Resilient Execution**: It wraps agent invocations with a global circuit breaker and error handling to prevent cascading failures and ensure the system remains stable [1].
*   **Dynamic Configuration**: It allows for runtime updates to its behavior, such as modifying routing keywords, enabling a clearer separation between logic and configuration [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`Supervisor`**: The primary class that encapsulates all logic for building the graph, routing between agents, processing requests, and providing monitoring statistics [1].
*   **`SupervisorConfig`**: A `dataclass` that holds all configurable parameters for the supervisor, such as default agents, routing keywords, and feature flags like `human-in-the-loop` [1].
*   **`SupervisorError`**: A custom exception class for handling errors specific to the supervisor's operation, such as initialization failures [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

*   **`core.state`**: Depends on `AssistantState` to define the structure of the data that flows through the graph [1].
*   **`core.error_handling`**: Utilizes the `ErrorHandler` to manage and log exceptions during initialization [1].
*   **`core.circuit_breaker`**: Directly imports and uses the `global_circuit_breaker` to add resilience to agent nodes [1].
*   **`langgraph.graph` and `langgraph.prebuilt`**: Heavily relies on `StateGraph` and `ToolNode` to construct the core workflow [1].
*   **`langchain_core.messages`**: Uses `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` to inspect conversation history for routing and tool-call decisions [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`initialize(agents, all_tools, checkpointer)`**: The main setup method that validates inputs and constructs the compiled LangGraph workflow. This is where all nodes and edges are defined [1].
*   **`process(state)`**: The primary entry point for executing a conversational turn. It invokes the compiled graph with the current state and returns the final state [1].
*   **`_enhanced_route_to_agent(state)`**: The core routing logic. It inspects the last `HumanMessage` and uses keyword matching from the `SupervisorConfig` to select the next agent [1].
*   **`_create_resilient_agent_node(agent, agent_name)`**: A wrapper function that turns an agent into a robust graph node by adding circuit breaker protection and graceful error handling [1].
*   **`_should_continue_to_tools(state)`**: A conditional edge function that checks if the last `AIMessage` contains tool calls, deciding whether to route to the `ToolNode` or end the turn [1].
*   **`update_routing_keywords(agent_name, keywords)`**: A public method that allows for dynamic, runtime modification of the keyword-based routing logic [1].
*   **`get_routing_statistics()`**: A monitoring method that provides insights into routing decisions, errors, and the current configuration [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing must validate the supervisor's ability to correctly build the graph, route requests based on content, handle failures gracefully, and respond to dynamic configuration changes.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   The accuracy and fallback behavior of the keyword-based routing logic in `_enhanced_route_to_agent` [1].
*   The structural integrity of the compiled graph, ensuring all nodes and conditional edges are correctly wired [1].
*   The resilience of agent nodes, specifically verifying that the circuit breaker and try/except blocks prevent graph crashes [1].
*   The complete end-to-end flow of a state object through a multi-step turn (e.g., user request -> agent -> tool call -> agent -> final response).
*   The effectiveness of the dynamic configuration methods (`update_routing_keywords`, `set_configuration`) [1].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   `Supervisor.initialize()`
*   `Supervisor.process()`
*   `Supervisor._enhanced_route_to_agent()`
*   `Supervisor.update_routing_keywords()`

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Initialization**:
    - Test that `initialize` succeeds with valid agents and tools.
    - Test that `initialize` raises a `SupervisorError` if no agents are provided [1].
    - Test the validation logic that selects a new default agent if the configured one is not found [1].
2.  **Routing Logic**:
    - Pass a state with a `HumanMessage` containing "write a python script" and assert `_enhanced_route_to_agent` returns "coder" [1].
    - Pass a state with a generic greeting and assert it routes to the `default_agent` [1].
3.  **Error Handling**:
    - Mock an agent node to raise an exception and assert that `_create_resilient_agent_node` catches it and returns a user-friendly `AIMessage` in the state without crashing [1].
4.  **Configuration**:
    - Call `update_routing_keywords` to add a new keyword for the "web" agent.
    - Process a message containing the new keyword and assert it now routes to "web" [1].
5.  **Tool Flow**:
    - Process a state where an agent returns an `AIMessage` with `tool_calls`.
    - Assert that the graph correctly routes to `call_tool` and then back to the originating agent via `_smart_continuation_logic` [1].
6.  **Statistics**:
    - Process several messages and call `get_routing_statistics` to verify that `total_routes` and `routes_by_agent` are incremented correctly [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**
*   **Highly Configurable**: The `SupervisorConfig` dataclass and dynamic update methods provide excellent flexibility, allowing operators to tune routing without code changes [1].
*   **Resilient by Design**: The proactive integration of circuit breakers and node-level error handling makes the graph robust against failures from individual agents or tools [1].
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns**: The supervisor effectively orchestrates the flow without needing to know the internal implementation of the agents, promoting modularity.
*   **Modern LangGraph Patterns**: The implementation correctly uses modern LangGraph 0.4.8 features like `StateGraph`, conditional edges, and optional `human-in-the-loop` interrupts, demonstrating up-to-date practices [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**
*   **Brittle Routing Logic**: Keyword-based routing is simple but lacks semantic understanding. It can fail on synonyms or complex phrasing and is not easily scalable to many agents with overlapping domains.
*   **Tight Coupling to Globals**: The direct import and use of `global_circuit_breaker` creates a hidden dependency and singleton state, which can complicate testing and parallel execution.
*   **Use of `typing.Any`**: The type hints for agents and tools are `dict[str, Any]` and `list[Any]`. This reduces type safety and makes it harder for developers to understand the required interfaces for agents and tools [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**
1.  **Implement LLM-Based Routing**:
    - For more robust and scalable routing, replace the keyword-based `_enhanced_route_to_agent` with an "LLM-as-a-router" approach. This involves a call to a fast, cheap LLM that is prompted to select the next agent from a list. This pattern is common in advanced agentic systems and provides superior semantic understanding [5].
2.  **Use Dependency Injection**:
    - Refactor the `Supervisor` to accept dependencies like the circuit breaker manager in its `__init__` or `initialize` method. This eliminates the reliance on global singletons, making the supervisor more modular, reusable, and easier to test in isolation.
3.  **Define Agent/Tool Protocols**:
    - Introduce `typing.Protocol` classes to define the expected interface for an "agent" (e.g., must have an `ainvoke` method) and a "tool". Using these protocols instead of `Any` for type hints will significantly improve code clarity, type safety, and developer experience.


## **File 9: `file_tools.py`**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `tools/file_tools.py` file provides a comprehensive and security-hardened suite of tools for file and workspace management [1]. It acts as a robust wrapper around the standard `langchain_community.agent_toolkits.FileManagementToolkit`, extending its functionality with custom, advanced tools designed for a production environment.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Secure Operations**: Enforces a strict security model, validating all file operations against allowed extensions, safe paths, and maximum file sizes [1].
*   **Enhanced Functionality**: Offers high-level tools beyond basic I/O, such as project scaffolding (`create_project`), intelligent file search (`search_in_files`), and asynchronous workspace organization (`organize_workspace_async`) [1].
*   **Rich Metadata and Analytics**: Provides detailed file information (`file_info`) and aggregates workspace statistics (`get_workspace_statistics`), including operation counts and security status [1].
*   **Modern Python Implementation**: Leverages modern Python 3.13 features like `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent operations and `match-case` for clean, readable logic [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`FileSystemTools`**: The primary class that initializes the workspace, manages security configurations, and provides the complete set of file management tools [1].
*   **`FileSecurityConfig`**: A `dataclass` that centralizes all security rules, such as allowed extensions and blocked paths, making the security model explicit and configurable [1].
*   **`FileOperationResult`**: A `dataclass` used to return structured, detailed results from file operations, including success status, metadata, and performance metrics [1].
*   **`FileOperation`**: An `Enum` that defines and standardizes the types of file operations for clear tracking and statistics [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

*   **`config.settings`**: Used to retrieve the default `workspace_dir` path [1].
*   **`core.error_handling`**: The `ErrorHandler` is referenced, though not directly used in the provided snippet, implying its potential use for wrapping tool calls at a higher level [1].
*   **`langchain_core.tools`**: Uses the `@tool` decorator to define custom LangChain tools [1].
*   **`langchain_community.agent_toolkits`**: Leverages the base `FileManagementToolkit` for standard file operations [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`get_tools()`**: The main public method that aggregates and returns a list of all available tools, combining the base LangChain tools with the custom, enhanced ones [1].
*   **`create_project(project_name, project_type)`**: A powerful scaffolding tool that creates detailed project structures for various types (Python, web, data, API, ML) using modern templates [1].
*   **`organize_workspace_async(dry_run, create_date_folders)`**: An asynchronous tool that organizes files into categorized folders, using `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent processing [1].
*   **`convert_file_format(filename, output_format)`**: A flexible tool for converting between common data formats like JSON, YAML, and CSV, using `match-case` for conversion logic [1].
*   **`search_in_files(query, file_extension)`**: A tool to perform text searches across files in the workspace, with options for case sensitivity and filtering [1].
*   **`file_info(filename, include_content_analysis)`**: A comprehensive analysis tool that provides detailed metadata about a file, including hashes, permissions, and optional content analysis [1] [3].
*   **`get_workspace_statistics()`**: An analytics tool that calculates and reports on workspace metrics, such as file counts, total size, and operation history [1] [7].
*   **`_validate_file_operation(filename, operation)`**: A crucial internal security method that checks every operation against the defined `FileSecurityConfig` [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should cover the full lifecycle of the `FileSystemTools`, from initialization to the correct and secure functioning of every custom tool, with a strong focus on edge cases and error handling.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   The proper initialization of the workspace and the aggregation of both base and custom tools in `get_tools()` [1].
*   The robustness of the security model: ensure operations on disallowed file types or unsafe paths are correctly blocked [1].
*   The correctness of the project scaffolding tool (`create_project`) for all defined project types [1].
*   The accuracy of the file format conversions (`convert_file_format`), especially with complex or malformed inputs [1].
*   The asynchronous `organize_workspace_async` tool, including its `dry_run` functionality and correct handling of file conflicts.
*   The accuracy and completeness of the data returned by `file_info` and `get_workspace_statistics` [1].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   `FileSystemTools.get_tools()`
*   Each individual custom tool (e.g., `create_project`, `search_in_files`, etc.).
*   `FileSystemTools._validate_file_operation()` to directly test security logic.

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Security Validation**:
    - Attempt to write a file with a disallowed extension (e.g., `.exe`). Assert that the operation is blocked by the security validation [1].
    - Attempt a file operation on a path outside the workspace directory. Assert it is blocked.
2.  **Project Creation**:
    - Call `create_project` for `project_type="python"`. Verify that all expected files and directories (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `src/`, `tests/`) are created [1].
3.  **File Conversion**:
    - Create a sample CSV file, convert it to JSON using `convert_file_format`, and then convert it back to CSV. Assert that the final CSV matches the original [1].
4.  **Async Organization**:
    - Populate the workspace with various file types. Call `organize_workspace_async(dry_run=True)`. Assert that the returned report is accurate but no files were moved.
    - Call again with `dry_run=False` and assert that files are moved to the correct category folders [1].
5.  **Search and Info**:
    - Create a file with specific content. Use `search_in_files` to find it. Use `file_info` to get its metadata and assert the returned hash and size are correct [1].
6.  **Error Handling**:
    - Call `backup_file` with a non-existent filename and assert that a user-friendly error message is returned [1].
    - Test conversions with malformed input files to ensure they fail gracefully [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**

*   **Security-First Design**: The proactive security model (`FileSecurityConfig`, `_validate_file_operation`) is a critical strength, making the tools safe for agentic use by default [1].
*   **High-Value Abstractions**: Tools like `create_project` and `organize_workspace_async` provide significant value beyond basic file I/O, enabling more complex agent behaviors [1].
*   **Excellent Developer Experience**: The use of `dataclasses` for results, `Enum` for operations, and detailed, well-formatted docstrings makes the module easy to use and understand [1].
*   **Modern and Performant**: The adoption of Python 3.13 features like `asyncio.TaskGroup` demonstrates a commitment to modern, efficient code [1] [5].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

*   **Potential for Blocking I/O in Async Tools**: While `organize_workspace_async` is designed to be async, the `shutil.move` call within it is a synchronous, blocking operation. For a large number of files, this could still block the event loop.
*   **Monolithic Class**: The `FileSystemTools` class is becoming large and handles many distinct responsibilities (basic I/O, project scaffolding, analytics). This could be broken down further.
*   **Hardcoded Project Templates**: The file content for the `create_project` templates is hardcoded within the methods. This makes them difficult to update or customize without modifying the source code.

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Use `asyncio.to_thread` for Blocking Calls**:
    - In `_organize_file_async`, the `shutil.move` call should be wrapped with `await asyncio.to_thread(shutil.move, ...)` to ensure it runs in a separate thread and does not block the asyncio event loop. The same should be applied to any other blocking file I/O inside `async` methods.
2.  **Refactor into Smaller, Focused Classes**:
    - Consider splitting the functionality. For example, create a `ProjectScaffoldingTools` class for `create_project` and its helpers, and a `WorkspaceAnalyticsTools` class for `get_workspace_statistics` and `file_info`. The main `FileSystemTools` class could then compose these smaller classes.
3.  **Externalize Project Templates**:
    - Move the project template files (e.g., the content for `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, etc.) into a separate `templates` directory. The `create_project` methods would then read from these template files instead of having them as hardcoded strings. This would make the templates much easier to manage, version, and customize.

## **File 10: `llm_manager.py`**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `config/llm_manager.py` file provides a sophisticated, centralized service for managing the entire lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the application [1]. It is designed as a universal client with a focus on performance, resilience, and observability.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Intelligent Caching**: Implements a robust, asynchronous caching mechanism to reuse initialized model objects, significantly reducing latency and resource consumption on subsequent calls [1].
*   **Concurrency and Rate Limiting**: Manages concurrent requests to LLM providers using both global and provider-specific `asyncio.Semaphore` objects to prevent rate-limiting errors [1].
*   **Resilience and Error Handling**: Integrates with the application's circuit breaker and provides a built-in, configurable retry mechanism with exponential backoff for generation requests [1].
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Actively tracks detailed token usage, estimates costs, and provides extensive statistics and performance metrics for health monitoring and analytics [1].
*   **Dynamic Health Checks**: Periodically runs asynchronous health checks against all configured LLM providers to ensure they are responsive, using `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent execution [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`LLMManager`**: The primary class that encapsulates all management logic, including model caching, generation, concurrency control, and health monitoring. It is implemented as a global singleton instance [1].
*   **`ModelInfo`**: A `dataclass` that stores the cached model object along with rich metadata, including its state, usage count, error history, and timestamps [1].
*   **`TokenUsage`**: A `dataclass` for aggregating detailed token consumption and cost estimation metrics, broken down by provider and model [1].
*   **`ModelState`**: An `Enum` defining the possible states of a cached model (`UNINITIALIZED`, `READY`, `ERROR`, etc.) for clear state management [1].

### **Internal Imports / Linked Files**

*   **`config.settings`**: Imports the central `config` object to access provider and node configurations from `llm_config.yaml` [1].
*   **`core.circuit_breaker`**: Imports and directly uses the `global_circuit_breaker` to wrap external API calls, adding a layer of resilience [1].
*   **`langsmith`**: Conditionally imports `traceable` if LangSmith is available and configured, providing a fallback decorator if it is not [1].
*   **`langchain.chat_models`**: Uses `init_chat_model` as the core function for instantiating LLM clients [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`_get_model(node_name, ...)`**: The core of the caching logic. It uses an async-safe lock to prevent race conditions while initializing a model for a specific configuration, returning a cached instance if available [1].
*   **`generate_for_node(node_name, ...)`**: The main entry point for generating text. It orchestrates concurrency control, retry logic, and calls the circuit breaker before invoking the model [1].
*   **`generate_batch_for_nodes(requests)`**: A highly efficient method for concurrent generation that uses `asyncio.TaskGroup` to process multiple requests in parallel [1].
*   **`health_check()`**: A proactive monitoring function that concurrently checks the health of all configured providers by making small, test generation calls [1].
*   **`get_usage_stats()` / `get_performance_metrics()`**: Public methods that return comprehensive, aggregated data on token usage, costs, cache performance, and error rates for observability [1].
*   **`warm_up_models(node_names)`**: A utility to pre-initialize specified models, typically at application startup, to reduce latency on the first user request [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing should validate the manager's core responsibilities: the correctness and performance of the caching system, the effectiveness of concurrency controls, the resilience mechanisms, and the accuracy of the monitoring data.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   **The caching mechanism**: Verify that models with identical configurations are reused and not re-initialized on every call [2].
*   **Concurrency limits**: Ensure that the global and provider-specific semaphores correctly limit the number of simultaneous API calls [2].
*   **Retry and circuit breaker integration**: Confirm that failing API calls trigger the retry logic and that the circuit breaker is invoked correctly [2].
*   **Token and cost tracking**: Validate that the `TokenUsage` dataclass accurately aggregates statistics from generation responses [2].
*   **Configuration handling**: Test that the manager correctly reads configurations from `llm_config.yaml` and handles missing or invalid node/provider definitions gracefully [2].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   `LLMManager.generate_for_node()`
*   `LLMManager._get_model()`
*   `LLMManager.health_check()`
*   `LLMManager.generate_batch_for_nodes()`

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Model Caching**:
    - Call `_get_model("chat")` twice. Assert that the returned model object is the same instance.
    - Call `_get_model("chat", override_max_tokens=500)`. Assert that this returns a new, different model instance because the cache key has changed [2].
2.  **Concurrency Control**:
    - Use `asyncio.gather` to launch more `generate_for_node` tasks than the global semaphore limit. Mock the API call with a `sleep` and assert that the total execution time reflects the throttling.
3.  **Retry Logic**:
    - Mock `_generate_with_model` to raise an exception. Call `generate_for_node` and assert that it is called `max_retries + 1` times and that the delay between calls increases exponentially [2].
4.  **Health Check**:
    - Mock `_health_check_provider` to return both healthy and unhealthy states. Call `health_check` and assert that the returned dictionary accurately reflects the status of all providers [2].
5.  **Error Handling**:
    - Attempt to generate for a node name that does not exist in the configuration. Assert that a `ValueError` is raised [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**
*   **Performance-Oriented**: The async-safe caching is the most critical feature, drastically improving performance and reducing costs by eliminating redundant model initializations [1].
*   **Highly Resilient**: The combination of built-in retries, provider-specific concurrency limits, and integration with a global circuit breaker makes the system robust against transient API failures [1].
*   **Excellent Observability**: The detailed tracking of token usage, costs, and performance metrics provides deep insight into the operational health and efficiency of the LLM layer [1].
*   **Modern and Efficient**: The code effectively uses modern Python 3.13 features like `asyncio.TaskGroup` for concurrent batching and health checks, ensuring high performance [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**
*   **Global Singleton Pattern**: The use of a single, globally imported instance (`llm_manager`) creates hidden state and tight coupling, which complicates unit testing and can lead to unpredictable behavior in complex applications [1].
*   **Hardcoded Configurations**: Key operational parameters, such as the provider-specific concurrency limits (`MAX_PROVIDER_CALLS`), are hardcoded in the `_initialize_concurrency_controls` method. This makes them difficult to tune in a production environment without code changes [1].
*   **Coupled Health Checks**: The `_health_check_provider` method has direct knowledge of the application's configuration structure, creating temporary node configs to perform its checks. This couples the generic manager logic to specific application config patterns [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**
1.  **Adopt Dependency Injection**:
    - Refactor the application to avoid the global `llm_manager` instance. The `LLMManager` should be instantiated at the application's entry point and explicitly passed to the components that need it (e.g., `AgentFactory`). This eliminates global state, clarifies dependencies, and vastly improves testability by allowing for the injection of mock managers.
2.  **Externalize Operational Configurations**:
    - Move operational parameters like `MAX_PROVIDER_CALLS` and `retry_attempts` from the Python code into the `llm_config.yaml` file. The `LLMManager` would then read these values from the config during initialization. This allows operators to tune performance and resilience parameters without deploying new code.
3.  **Decouple Health Checks via a Generic Interface**:
    - Instead of creating temporary node configurations, the health check could be made more generic. It could be designed to simply test the provider's base API endpoint with a minimal, standardized payload, removing the dependency on the application's specific `NodeConfig` structure. This would make the `LLMManager` a more portable and reusable component.

## **File 11: `circuit_breaker.py`**

### **Architectural Overview**

The `core/circuit_breaker.py` file implements a production-grade circuit breaker system with adaptive thresholds, comprehensive metrics tracking, and proactive health monitoring [1]. It provides intelligent protection for external services in AI applications through sophisticated failure detection, recovery mechanisms, and deep observability features.

Key responsibilities include:
*   **Adaptive Service Protection**: Dynamically adjusts failure thresholds based on service health scores, using multiple trip conditions including consecutive failures, error rates, and slow call detection [1].
*   **Comprehensive Metrics Collection**: Tracks 20+ metrics per service including error distributions, response time percentiles (P95, P99), throughput rates, and rolling window statistics [1].
*   **Proactive Health Monitoring**: Performs concurrent health checks across all configured services using Python 3.13's `TaskGroup` for efficient parallel execution [1].
*   **Resilient Execution Patterns**: Provides both decorator (`@with_circuit_breaker`) and context manager patterns for seamless integration with existing code [1].

### **Main Classes**

*   **`AdvancedCircuitBreaker`**: Central orchestrator managing circuit states, service configurations, and health monitoring with adaptive behavior [1].
*   **`ServiceMetrics`**: Comprehensive metrics tracking class that calculates error rates, response time percentiles, health scores, and maintains rolling window statistics [1].

### **Key Functions and Methods**

*   **`call_with_circuit_breaker(service_name, func, *args, **kwargs)`**: Main execution method with timeout handling, metrics recording, and state transition logic [1].
*   **`_should_trip_circuit(circuit)`**: Complex trip logic combining consecutive failures, error rate thresholds, and slow call detection [1].
*   **`health_check_all_services()`**: Concurrent health checks using `TaskGroup` with fallback to sequential execution [1].
*   **`update_adaptive_threshold()`**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on health scores using match-case logic [1].
*   **`get_statistics_summary()`**: Comprehensive report generation with health scores and performance metrics [1].
*   **`@with_circuit_breaker(service_name)`**: Decorator providing seamless circuit protection for async functions [1].
*   **`force_open_circuit()` / `force_close_circuit()`**: Manual override capabilities for maintenance scenarios [1].

### **What Should Be Tested**

Testing must validate the complete state machine lifecycle, adaptive threshold calculations, metrics accuracy, and integration with various external services under both normal and failure conditions.

### **Key Testing Focus**

*   **State Machine Integrity**: Complete transition flow from `CLOSED` → `OPEN` → `HALF_OPEN` → `CLOSED` with proper timing and conditions [1].
*   **Adaptive Threshold Logic**: Verification that thresholds adjust correctly based on health scores (0.0-1.0 scale) [1].
*   **Metrics Accuracy**: Validation of 95th/99th percentile calculations, error rate computations, and rolling window behavior [1].
*   **Concurrent Health Checks**: Reliability of `TaskGroup` execution with mixed success/failure scenarios [1].
*   **Service-Specific Behavior**: Proper handling of different service types (LLM providers, file system, database) [1].

### **Main Entry Points for Testing**

*   `AdvancedCircuitBreaker.call_with_circuit_breaker()`
*   `ServiceMetrics.record_call()`
*   `health_check_all_services()`
*   `_transition_to_half_open()` and related state methods
*   `@with_circuit_breaker` decorator functionality

### **Required Test Cases**

1.  **Adaptive Threshold Validation**:
    - Test health scores from 0.2 to 0.9 and verify threshold multipliers (1.5x for healthy, 0.5x for poor health) [1].
    - Simulate 50% error rate with sufficient throughput and verify circuit trips based on `error_rate_threshold` [1].

2.  **State Transition Sequence**:
    - Trigger `OPEN` state via consecutive failures → wait `recovery_timeout` → verify `HALF_OPEN` → succeed 3x → confirm `CLOSED` [1].
    - Test manual override with `force_open_circuit()` and verify it persists through auto-recovery attempts [1].

3.  **Concurrent Health Check Execution**:
    - Mock 10+ service endpoints and verify `TaskGroup` completes all checks within timeout [1].
    - Test fallback to sequential execution when `TaskGroup` fails [1].

4.  **Metrics Accuracy and Performance**:
    - Generate 1000 calls with random failures/durations and verify percentile calculations within 1% accuracy [1].
    - Test rolling window behavior ensuring calls older than `window_size` are excluded [1].

5.  **Service-Specific Health Checks**:
    - Test health checks for each service type: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Tavily, file system, database [1].
    - Verify proper error handling when services are unavailable or misconfigured [1].

### **Architectural Review & Recommendations**

#### **Strengths**

*   **Production-Grade Resilience**: Implements sophisticated adaptive thresholds that automatically adjust based on service health scores (0-1 scale), providing intelligent protection [1].
*   **Deep Observability**: Tracks 23+ metrics per service including P99 response times, error distributions, and health trends for comprehensive monitoring [1].
*   **Modern Python 3.13.4 Features**: Effectively uses `TaskGroup` for concurrent operations, `match-case` for clean logic, and proper type hints with `collections.abc.Mapping` [1].
*   **Flexible Integration**: Provides multiple integration patterns (decorator, context manager, direct calls) with both sync and async function support [1].

#### **Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

*   **Global Singleton Pattern**: Single `global_circuit_breaker` instance limits scalability for multi-tenant scenarios and complicates testing [1].
*   **Tight Service Coupling**: Health check methods have hardcoded knowledge of specific modules (`llm_manager`, `settings`), creating unnecessary dependencies [1].
*   **Memory Overhead**: Maintaining 1000-call history buffers per service can consume 2-5MB per service in high-traffic scenarios [1].
*   **Hardcoded Service Configurations**: Default configurations in `_initialize_default_configs()` are embedded in code, making runtime tuning difficult [1].

#### **Recommendations for Enhancement**

1.  **Implement Circuit Breaker Sharding**:
    ```
    class AdvancedCircuitBreaker:
        def __init__(self, namespace: str = "default"):
            self.namespace = namespace
            self.circuits: dict[str, CircuitBreakerState] = {}
    ```
    This enables multi-tenant deployments and better resource isolation.

2.  **Decouple Health Checks via Registration**:
    ```
    def register_health_check(self, service_name: str, check_fn: Callable):
        self.health_checks[service_name] = check_fn
    ```
    Services would register their own health check functions, eliminating tight coupling.

3.  **Optimize Memory with Circular Buffers**:
    ```
    from array import array
    self.response_times = array('f', [0.0] * 1000)  # 4 bytes vs 28 bytes per float
    ```
    Use typed arrays instead of Python objects for significant memory reduction.

4.  **Externalize Service Configurations**:
    Move service configs to `circuit_breaker_config.yaml` for runtime tuning without code deployments.

5.  **Add Service Criticality Weighting**:
    ```
    class ServiceConfig:
        criticality: float = 1.0  # 1.0-5.0 scale for health score weighting
    ```
    Prioritize critical services in overall health scoring and recovery logic.
